Take two variables as n and n1, and declare that variables ith hex values.
Hex value of n can be leftshifted with 2 and also store into the variable n.
Then check whether the n value is equal to 0x06.
If n value is equal to 6 then do n1|=((1<<7)|(1<<6)|(1<<3))...(because need to set those three bits 7,6 and 3).
Then print n1 value as a result.
